## Background (written by the main agent, 2026-11-09)
* TF-IDF word+char LinearSVC: grouped CV 0.368, LB 0.348.
* LightGBM on 316 style features, trained on 100k external passages: 0.365 on train.csv (unseen).
* Blend 0.5/0.5 (T=3): CV 0.419, LB 0.402. Sinkhorn class balancing: 0.422.
* Group assignment on that blend (research/assign_eval.py): oracle prompt groups 0.526, found groups 0.520.
  LB probe 2026-11-09: **0.367 vs 0.402 without it. Dead end**: the hidden test is not built like train.csv.
  Decide on `raw`; sinkhorn is being checked on the LB next.
* Qwen3-4B base, QLoRA r=16, multi-scale head (mean pool at depths 2..24, 24 layers kept). Stage 1 `run2` on
  pool_typo_60k (60k external passages, typography-filtered), lr 1e-4 / head 1e-3, warmup 0.1, 1,875 steps,
  local RTX 4060. Validation = train.csv minus fold 4, 900-row stratified subset:
  step 500 raw 0.400 / sinkhorn 0.452; 750 0.393 / 0.454; 1000 0.463 / 0.502. Finishes about 04:15.
* Kaggle inference parity (run2 step 500 + LGBM, sinkhorn, same 900 rows): 0.464 on Kaggle T4 fp16, matches local.
* Kaggle ntl-qwen-train (main agent): k_host1 = stage 1 on pool + hostlike, k_host3 = pool + hostlike x3,
  started about 02:10, about 6.5 h. Compare with run2 to learn whether host-faithful data helps stage 1.
* Dead ends so far: run1 (36-layer seqcls head) learned slower than multi-scale; bf16 on T4 is 4x slower than fp16.
